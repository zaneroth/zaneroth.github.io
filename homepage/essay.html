    <h1>Hexagon Tiles and Home
</h1>
 	Mom puts me on the back of her bike, pedals down Tenth Avenue, and goes crosstown on 14th street.  From my Schwinn child carrier seat, I can’t see over her head, but as I see the Chelsea Diner, Rite Aid and the Jefferson Market Library zipping by, I already know where we are going.
As I take the same route on my Citi Bike on this hot summer day, I carefully stay within the bike lane as I snake through the streets. I know now, just as I knew then, Washington Square Park is my destination.
	When I make the transition from the bland sidewalk boxes to the gum-filled grey hexagons, I know I’m back home.  The residents nod as they see my familiar face join the fray: the piano player who lugs his baby grand piano on wheels every Saturday that the weather is half-way decent; the 20-year-old skateboarder who does tricks around the fountain and high-fives passers-by whenever he lands a new trick; and the tarot card reader, wearing his tall, pointed hat accentuated with stars and moons.  We may not know each other's names, but we are certainly not strangers.
	Each person in Washington Square is there for a different reason.  There are those who speed through, taking important calls with their heads down, and some who sit quietly on benches observing the wildlife of people.  I often wonder whether the pigeon man is there every day or just Saturdays.  While the city is broken up into many sections and boroughs, Washington Square is a neutral ground for all.
	People walk in wearing suits and ties; quickly, they take off their sports jackets, revealing T-shirts displaying graphics from their favorite television shows.  The leather Allen Edmonds Cap-Toe Oxford shoes come off and the synthetic plastic Adidas shoes slip on.  The work is done for today; it's time to say hello to friends in a circle playing games on the grass.  Entering this park feels like a weight lifted off your shoulders.  The pressure of life flies off with the pigeons and what is left is a group of fun folks and good times.
	When I'm not playing tag around the fountain or watching dogs play in the dog run, I find myself heading to the southeast corner of the playground to release the day’s tension.  I find a sense of calm as I rock back and forth on a swing.  I close my eyes and imagine I'm on a roller coaster at Disney; slowly, the ride picks up speed, until at a certain point the seat moves out from under and you feel truly weightless, flying and removed from the world.  Feeling a grumble in my stomach, I hop off the seat and gather my things.  I head over to the Japanese deli and get a bento box.  The closet bench I know is on Waverly and Washington Square North.
       While en route to sit and eat, I hear the squeaking of metal.  It is 8:00 and dark, as I walk past the divot in the benches which the homeless call home, I observe a young man on a swing enjoying his time alone.  He pumps his legs, wanting to feel like a kid again being pushed by his mom high into the sky.  He remembers what it was like to not have a care in the world: no school work, no college, and no worries about what the future has to hold.  The weightless feeling is cut short by gravity pulling him down to earth.
	Growing up, many of my friends lived around Washington Square, and to this day, some still do. Each exit is an entrance to a different person's home and a different experience. The north exit leads to Etai’s house; every other month, my family and I are invited to Shabbat at his apartment where we reconnect with our religion and heritage. The east exit leads to Hudson’s house; we write comedy together and laugh until our faces and stomachs hurt. The south exit leads to Liam’s house; here I am most comfortable discussing personal stories while playing extremely competitive games of Super Smash Brothers. The west exit leads to George’s house; we take his dog for a walk in the park while talking about science, comics, and everything in between.
 Each house is a different room connected to the living room of Washington Square Park. A home is not defined by four walls.
